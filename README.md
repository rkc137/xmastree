# xmastree
simple terminal xmastree with music
to buld you need:
https://www.sfml-dev.org/
and dir "music" wth your music

In short, it was a gift for the new year, but in the end no one even downloaded and looked at it :(
I donâ€™t want it to just disappear, maybe someone will enjoy this

how to use:
`xmstree -t [tall] -f "[path to your music]"`
also you can use `-ignmp3` to ignore mp3 files (sfml dont work with that)
or `-ign` to ignore all not available files
